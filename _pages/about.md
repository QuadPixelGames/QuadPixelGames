## 🧠 About QuadPixel

QuadPixel is a tiny but mighty indie game studio focused on making chaotic, weird, and wildly fun games that don’t take themselves too seriously — and neither do we.

We’re all about ideas that make people go “wait, what?” and then “okay that was actually fun.” Whether it’s a gun that shoots beach balls, faceless blobs jumping through portals, or Kartik flapping through pipes, if it makes us laugh or rage-quit, it probably belongs in a QuadPixel game.

We're not here to win GOTY. We’re here to make dumb fun — and maybe break a few rules while we’re at it.

Come play.
