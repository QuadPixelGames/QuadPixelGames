So one day, there I was, thinking about making a video game. 
"Hmmm... but doing this alone wouldn't be fun? What if the members of Gamer Trio also become the members of QuadPixel?", I thought.

I used the Unity FPS Microgame template to make our first game, "Blaster Balls"! (still in developement sorry!)

So who are the members?
They are:
- *Aatiksh Sinha*
- *Sarthak Dhakne*
- *Shankh Maity*
- *Kartik Waradkar*
